# Laravel Bones Keeper (bones-keeper)

## Before You Get Started

- This package depends on a BaseModel, belonging to the root namespace, so that it can be referenced by `\BaseModel`. Your BaseModel class should implement your ORM of choice (by default Eloquent); we will use this to connect to the database.

## Installation

To install bones-keeper package (terminal):

```sh
composer require genealabs/bones-keeper:*
```

or manually add it to you composer.json file:

```json
    "require": {
        /* ... */,
        "genealabs/bones-keeper": "*"
    },
    /* ... */
```

And then add the service provider to your app.php config file:
```php
	// 'providers' => array(
		'GeneaLabs\Bones\Keeper\BonesKeeperServiceProvider',
    // );
```

Now we need to make the assets available (terminal):
```php
php artisan asset:publish genealabs/bones-keeper
```
